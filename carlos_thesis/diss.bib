Theory showing the monotone behaviour of the likelihood and convergence of the algorithm is derived. Many examples are sketched, including missing value situations, applications to grouped, censored or truncated data, finite mixture models, variance component estimation, hyperparameter estimation, iteratively reweighted least squares and factor analysis.},

 ISSN = {00063444},

 abstract = {Closed form representations of the gradients and an approximation to the Hessian are given for an asymptotic approximation to the log likelihood function of a multidimensional autoregressive moving average Gaussian process. Their use for the numerical maximization of the likelihood function is discussed. It is shown that the procedure described by Hannan (1969) for the estimation of the parameters of one-dimensional autoregressive moving average processes is equivalent to a three-stage realization of one step of the Newton-Raphson procedure for the numerical maximization of the likelihood function, using the gradient and the approximate Hessian. This makes it straightforward to extend the procedure to the multidimensional case. The use of the block Toeplitz type characteristic of the approximate Hessian is pointed out.},

abstract="Single-cell transcriptomics allows researchers to investigate complex communities of heterogeneous cells. It can be applied to stem cells and their descendants in order to chart the progression from multipotent progenitors to fully differentiated cells. While a variety of statistical and computational methods have been proposed for inferring cell lineages, the problem of accurately characterizing multiple branching lineages remains difficult to solve.",

abstract="This paper is a contribution to the methodology of fully Bayesian inference in a multivariate Gaussian mixture model using the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. To follow the constraints of preserving the first two moments before and after the split or combine moves, we concentrate on a simplified multivariate Gaussian mixture model, in which the covariance matrices of all components share a common eigenvector matrix. We then propose an approach to the construction of the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for this model. Experimental results on several data sets demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm.",

abstract="We present full Bayesian analysis of finite mixtures of multivariate normals with unknown number of components. We adopt reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo and we construct, in a manner similar to that of Richardson and Green (1997), split and merge moves that produce good mixing of the Markov chains. The split moves are constructed on the space of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the current covariance matrix so that the proposed covariance matrices are positive definite. Our proposed methodology has applications in classification and discrimination as well as heterogeneity modelling. We test our algorithm with real and simulated data.",

An effective computational strategy is presented for describing the posterior distribution.}",
