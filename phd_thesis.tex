\begin{acknowledgments}		% Optional
\index{Acknowledgments@\emph{Acknowledgments}}%
I would like to take the oportunity to thank all people that supported me throughout these 4 years of PhD studies.

First, I thank my advisor Peter for all his support in terms of research and mentoring and for always supporting all my academic decisions. Much of the knowledge I gathered within this 4 years came through your teachings and research experiences. I am also thankful for all the great oportunities that you brought to me. The possibility of working with you was one of the key factors for choosing to come to UT, a decision which I never regrated even the sligthest.

I thank my co-advisor Mingyuan for introducing me to Bayesian machine learning: I greatly enjoyed participating in the seminars and I learned a great deal out of them. Thanks for always being supportive.

To Yuan, I would like to thank for having supported me through 3 summers in NorthShore where I learned a great deal about Biostats and where I made awesome friends: Subhajit, Kamila, Shengjie, Li, Yitan... I also thank Yuan for being such a good mentor.

Also, I would like to thank the committee members Sinead and Yuan for accepting to participate on my defense as well as for overseeing my development in the program since the candidacy talk.

I also thank Veera and Fernando for the research collaborations and for offering great support in my academic life. I also thank Veera for the wonderful experience working with him in MD Anderson last summer.

I would like to take the time to thank to all the amazing people that I met during the PhD who will be great friends for life: Matteo, Su, Yang, Mo, Mingzhang, Mengjie, Carol, Giorgio, Ciara, Vera, Daiane, Lorenzo, Subhajit, Tianjian. Your friendship and support made these 4 years much more enjoyable and full of life. To Grayson, Grant, Caroline and Keegan, I express my sincere thanks for having received me so well when I arrived in United States.

To my brother and my parents I thank for the unconditional love and support and for believing in my potential.

Last but certainly not least, a very special thanks to Valquiria and Sarah, for being so supportive along the 4 years that I have been away most of the time. I love you and even being thousands of miles away, I always carry you close by in my heart.

I am thankful for the finantial support I received from the Statistics and Data Science department in the form of teaching assistantships and travel funds. This work was partialy funded by the University of Texas at Austin Graduate School Summer 2019 Fellowship.

This work develops new methodology for Bayesian dependent mixture models and dependent random partitions with applications to biomedical data. A mixture model implies a random distribution over partitions by randomly assigning individual observations to latent subpopulations that correspond to the distinct components of the mixture. Subpopulations are typically homogeneous, but heterogeneous accross groups. In the biomedical applications studied here, the mixture components capture different levels of gene/protein expression, distinct stages of cellular development or the response to exposition to distinct drugs. Multiple forms of dependence are considered in order to more accurately model biological features of the studied applications, including dependence over time, dependence by arrangement on a tree and by shared match with paired cell lines.
